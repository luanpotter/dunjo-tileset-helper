The [Dunjo Tileset](https://arks.itch.io/dungeon-platform-tileset) is a gorgeous 12x12 pixels tileset for generic dungeons made by [arks](https://arks.itch.io/) on itch.io.

It's so simple and beatiful it's the perfect set to use to start off your new game, or test your tileset engine; and since it's free under CC 4.0, you can keep it forever.

If you like the tileset, please consider buying it from [itch.io](https://arks.itch.io/dungeon-platform-tileset).

## And what is this?

This is just a repository to help you out by providing some ajusted resources. They are:

 * A version of the tileset without the s=1 setting (one pixel between chars): this will be necessary to use it with most tileset engines out there. The original version will add one pixel between each tile and a one-pixel border around everything. [This](tileset.png) is the s=0 version, ready to use.

 * An example map; it's the one provided by the author in the page, but I converted it to the ids of the tileset to help you re-create it in your game. It can be found [here](map.md).

## Licensing

This is all [arks](https://arks.itch.io) awesome work, and all credits go to him, none to me. Since his tileset is under CC 4.0, so is this.

Please pay him some respects on itch.io.
